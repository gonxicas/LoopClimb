# LoopClimb
This is a project I made for a master. In this project I had to make a game to express frustration, but I had some rules to follow. 
-The game can only be made with cubes.
-An object can only have up to four renderers (mesh renderer, sprite renderer ...) taking its children into account.
-The game can't have text or voices.
-Textures are forbidden.
